# Homework 02

Contained within the `data` folder are several CSVs and markdown files describing the columns of those CSVs. For the 2nd two problems you will need to
* Create a table within your database with appropriate data types
* Import the information from the appropriate CSV into that table
* Use the table to answer the questions given in the PDF, including possibly exporting information back out to another CSV file

Make sure when all is said and done that you have uploaded material that contains:
* The completed template files with your solutions and SQL commands
* Your newly created CSV files from questions that required an export
